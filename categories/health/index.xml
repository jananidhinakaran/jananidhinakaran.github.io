      <description>Meditation is becoming very popular nowadays but it is mainly mindfulness which is getting a lot of the attention. Trāṭaka is a less known type of meditation which appears in stories such as &amp;#8216;The Monk who Sold his Ferrari&amp;#8217; by Rabin Sharma and &amp;#8216;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&amp;#8217; by Roald Dahl.</description>

      <description>Prana can be translated to mean breath, though in subtle terms it is also associated with &amp;#8216;life force&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;vital energy&amp;#8217;. Ayama means control. Together, Pranayama means control of breath.</description>

      <description>The claim that meditation is good for you and can help improve or enhance one&amp;#8217;s mental and physical health is quite a remarkable claim.

      <description>When I ask people asked what they think it means to be healthy, I often get responses like: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s when you&amp;#8217;re not sick&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;To be fit&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;When all your parts are working properly&amp;#8221; These definitions seem focused on one&amp;#8217;s physical body and see health as a state in which going to a doctor is not necessary.</description>
