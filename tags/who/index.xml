      <description>When I ask people asked what they think it means to be healthy, I often get responses like: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s when you&amp;#8217;re not sick&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;To be fit&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;When all your parts are working properly&amp;#8221; These definitions seem focused on one&amp;#8217;s physical body and see health as a state in which going to a doctor is not necessary.</description>
