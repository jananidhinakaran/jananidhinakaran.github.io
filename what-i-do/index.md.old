  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My Role</strong></span><strong>:</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I work as a mind-body coach with people in high stress jobs or high stress personal situations. I help the client become more aware of the facts of their condition, create an individualised plan for them based on their concerns and limitations, teach them mind-body techniques and monitor them as their health and wellbeing improves.
</p>

I also give **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">talks</span>** and conduct **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">workshops</span>** apart from my **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">individual sessions with clients</span>**.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Most of my work is focused on psychosomatic problems, i.e. problems where the mind affects the body and the physical condition of the body affects the mental state,
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I also work preventatively to help people work through stressors such as major emotional events, chronic work or relationship related stress <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>before</em></span> they begin to affect the body negatively. I use various creative and effective approaches to improve and resolve my clients&#8217; conditions (mentioned below).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A person is healthy when they thrive, feel energetic and fulfilled. I show my clients how much more they can expect from their amazing bodies and minds than what they get by with.
